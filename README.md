Riemannian geometry enables the design of new machine learning methods suitable for an actual operation of an BCI under adverse conditions.

In this project,  I use connectivity matrices from EEG multi-channels in a machine learning pipeline in Python based on Riemannian geometry and evaluating its performance on a provided EEG signals dataset for a Mental workload classification task.

I uploaded 2 graphics : Results of classification for different classifiers and also using different connectivity matrices    " with KNN Riemann " .
